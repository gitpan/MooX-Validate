DESCRIPTION
    MooX::Validate is mashup between Validate::Class::Simple and Moo which
    provides minimalist validation and filtering automation. Validate::Class
    ships with a complete set of pre-defined validations and filters
    referred to as "directives". Moo is an extremely light-weight subset of
    Moose optimised for rapid startup and "pay only for what you use". It
    also avoids depending on any XS modules to allow simple deployments. The
    name "Moo" is based on the idea that it provides almost but not quite
    two thirds of Moose.
